- Correct use of image elements and file paths to image files

### Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?
No

### What went really well and what could have gone better?
I did attempt having  a light/dark theme but as  it did not look right with the current page layout.  Instead, I added an audio control for the user to hear the sounds of the city.


### Detailing useful external sources that helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials).
I used the MDN resources that have been mentioned in class.
